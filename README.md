# Rootbeer-Alteryx-Project
In this project, I am importing 9 tables into the Alteryx Designer and subsequently prepare, manipulate, transform and analyse data. This project was a great help in understanding specific nuances of ETL (Extract Transform Load) process

Some of the specific tasks I did:




Import and prepare the company's raw data for analysis

Identify and correct data errors

Join data from multiple sources

Calculate new metrics and dimensions

Create data visualizations to analyze the data

Generate reports to communicate the findings to stakeholders
